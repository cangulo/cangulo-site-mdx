## Description

Hi all,

Visual Studio Code has become one of the most important IDEs, but did you know it can be used for documentation? You only need to learn some Markdown basics!

In this meetup, we will go through that, as well as the following topics:

1. Markdown, when to use it? When not to use it?
2. VS Code, out of the box features
3. VS Code extensions for Markdown
4. VS Code snippets: How to increase your productivity with templates

The content is ideal for both developers and technical writers.

Join us to learn a new approach for documenting!
